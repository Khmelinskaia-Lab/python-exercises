    Ask to user to input a set of integers. Similar to the problems in
    HW set 1, loop up to the square root of all numbers, identify all
    the factors and store them in individual lists. Then compare the
    contents of the list to identify unique common factors (including
    1) and print them in ascending order.

    Write a function to identify the factors and store them in a list.
    You can then use set intersections.
